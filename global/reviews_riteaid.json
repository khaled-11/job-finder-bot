[{"title":"Repetitive work and low pay","text":"Depending on your location, you could either be stressed and running around or completely bored all day. If you are at a busy location you will be responsible for stocking shelves, putting up sale stickers, straightening isles, and more all while watching the register. At times this can be stressful and you will be running around your entire shift. At a less busy location you will spend much of your day watching the clock waiting for time to clock out and go home. Starting pay for me was $8.25 which is the legal minimum wage and is much lower than any other competing pharmacy such as CVS/Walgreens. Management is laidback for the most part, easy to get along with everyone if you aren't problematic. Flexibility is a plus, the overall environment is laidback, for example if you need to call out last minute or if you accidentally come in an hour late, as long as you don't make it a habit you should be cool.
