Other than this, the workplace culture and policies are extremely toxic. The employees are not valued as assets to the company, but rather seen as a number with a title level. People below management level are mostly disregarded and the overall environment has a regressive attitude that parallels 1960’s corporate culture, more so than anything in the 21st century.  Your safety and well being is only important if it impacts profits, otherwise you are readily sacrificed if it means maintaining production. Management rarely tries to build a team atmosphere. From my experience, most of management seem primarily concerned with the politics, looking good to their bosses, and acting as a mouthpiece for issuing new policy and department requirements with no feedback, since the opinions and voices of the employees below them are treated with extreme insignificance.","rating":"2","id":"1ecmdepcuqg5h800","language":"en","reviewer":"Engineer","location":"Austin, TX","url":"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Samsung-Electronics-9/reviews/toxic-workplace-culture-that-slowly-wears-on-everyone?id=8df2f83047b1466f","datetime":"2020-07-08 00:00:00","reviewer_employee_type":"Current Employee"},{"title":"Do not know","text":"Is a  an average company when it comes to opportunities.

Almost to a person, the folks that I interacted with were really good folks. I was part of the group that were the initial occupants of the preexisting facility that was finished out for Samsung at Legacy Central in Plano TX. The new facilities were very nice. The honor system snacks and drinks (not monitored by cashiers, but by cameras) with self-checkout were a great perk. BAD: Open office floor plan. It may have been the trendy thing to do for \"working collaboratively\" but, as a writer who needed a little peace and quiet to formulate my thoughts, I was not a fan. Samsung committed to the concept in the new facility well before the pandemic. Since I lost my job while we were still working from home, I'm not going to see in person how this plays out. But the preliminary answer to how to practice social distancing in the open office is to put a person a every other desk and alternate days when people come into the facility. I guess in an age of social distancing, working remotely will become the norm.","rating":"5","id":"1ec6fumd2p16g800","language":"en","reviewer":"Staff Technical Editor (Contract)","location":"Plano, TX (Legacy Central)","url":"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Samsung-Electronics-9/reviews/mixed-bag-for-a-tech-writer?id=084389f650744845","datetime":"2020-07-01 00:00:00","reviewer_employee_type":"Former Employee"},{"title":"Great Company!","text":"I love the work environment.
